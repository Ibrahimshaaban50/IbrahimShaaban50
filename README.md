# About Me
<hr style="border: 1px solid gray;">

Hi, I’m Ibrahim Shaaban, a passionate **Junior Embedded Systems Engineer & IoT Developer** with a focus on automotive applications. I specialize in developing embedded solutions and IoT systems that bridge hardware and software to deliver real-world impact. 🚗⚡

I have experience working with microcontrollers, sensors, and automotive interfaces, and I enjoy turning data into actionable insights. My graduation project involved creating an **IoT-Based Battery Monitoring System for Electric Vehicles**, where I collected real-time data via **CAN Bus** and **OBD-II** and visualized it through cloud dashboards using **ThingsBoard**.

I’ve worked in **various Embedded Systems projects** including **Arduino, AVR Cortex-M, ARM, ESP32, STM32, and Tiva C**, gaining hands-on experience with hardware interfacing, communication protocols, and IoT integration.  

I’ve completed **4+ mini projects** and **2 real-world projects**, building practical skills in embedded systems, automotive IoT, and sensor integration.  

I’m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and contribute to innovative automotive projects that make vehicles smarter and more efficient.
