# **About ME**


●👋 Hi there! I'm Ibrahim Shaaban, a passionate **Junior Embedded Systems Engineer & IoT Developer** with a focus on automotive applications. I specialize in creating efficient and innovative embedded solutions and IoT systems that bridge hardware and software.  

●🔭 I've worked in various Embedded Systems projects including Arduino, AVR, ARM Cortex-M, ESP32, STM32, Tiva C, collecting real-time data and integrating IoT solutions.  

●🤖 I've completed 4+ mini projects and 2 real-world projects, including my graduation project: **IoT-Based Battery Monitoring System for Electric Vehicles** (VW ID.4), where I collected data via CAN Bus & OBD-II and visualized it using ThingsBoard.    

●🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Embedded C++ and Automotive Data Analytics, while continuing hands-on work with embedded systems and IoT integration.  

●🤝 I’m looking to collaborate with innovative companies in automotive and embedded systems, contributing to smarter and more efficient solutions.
